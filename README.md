This repo will contain 
- Class definitions for the auditory periphery models: BEZ2018(through `matlabengine`), Zilany2014 (`cochlea` package), WSR model (`pyNSL` package)
- Runners for models
- Outputs of model simulations
- Stimuli? (Self note: I don't yet know where should I place that package. I think another repository/ sub repository? is that even possible?

  I am just separating repos for me to manage them better.
